# ElytraAutoEquipper
A Minecraft spigot server plugin that simply makes your life a little easier.

If you want to try it out, just download the jar here(https://github.com/Maikeio/ElytraAutoEquipper/releases) and add it to your plugin folder.

I think most Minecraft players know this problem: 
Yes, finally I got my Elytra, but oh
there is this problem with the slots. Now I have to choose between my chestplate and my Elytra.
But not with this plugin. Now you can just leave your Elytra somewhere in your inventory and
when you need it, just right-click on a firework rocket while you're in the air, so the Elytra will take the
Place with your chestplate and opens automatically. When you land, the chestplate immediately switches back.
